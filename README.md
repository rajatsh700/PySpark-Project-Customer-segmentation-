Customer Segmentation PySpark project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. It involves installing necessary libraries, initializing a Spark session, and loading the OnlineRetail.csv dataset into a Spark DataFrame. Initial exploration includes printing the schema, displaying the first few rows, and checking for null values. The project then groups data by country, filters for UK customers, and cleans the data by removing negative quantities and calculating TotalAmount. RFM values are computed in Pandas, and clustering is performed using K-Means after vectorizing and standardizing the features. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, and clustering results are visualized with count and box plots. This analysis helps identify customer segments for targeted marketing and improved retention strategies.
